Aims and Objectives
In this research, the main aim is to discover the possibility of using a generative adversarial networks [9] type framework to generate variations that includes hand-crafted features from a single 3 dimensional blueprint of a not hand-crafted object as well as discovering the implementation for achieving this aim. 
The main objectives of this research are shown in the following.
1.	Perform literature review
2.	Discuss the ethical, social and legal impact of the current research
3.	Define the handmade features
4.	Technical implementation
5.	Result evaluation
6.	Conclusion and future work
Within the technical implementation phase, the sub objectives are listed below.
1.	Finding an appropriate digital representation of a 3 dimensional blue print of an object
2.	Performing necessary data preprocessing
3.	Experiment with different types of GANs
1.	Build the specific type of GANs
2.	Adjust the parameters such as loss function, optimization function and so on
3.	Apply handmade features and make enhancement

Ideally in the end of the research, an approach of using a GANs type framework that is capable of generating variations of models with hand-crafted features base on a set of 3 dimensional model parameters can be discovered.
