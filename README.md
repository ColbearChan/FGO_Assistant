** FGO_Assistant**

This project was implemented during my second year of undergraudate. 
A game assisting program for the mobile game Fate Grand Order.  It controls and plays the redundent daily quests of the game including the money quest (I forgot what the currencies are called in the game) and the expeirence quest (The hands with pillars at the bottom, and fires in the palm) with a sepcific team setup.  


This code is only available for Android phones, and is been tested on xiaomi mix, multi phone screen scale adaption is not implemented yet.
